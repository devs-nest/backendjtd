Environment Setup:

Installation:-
    Node.js runs stably and reliably on all the three Operating Systems - 
    Linux, Windows & macOS.
    semver algo.
    <major>.<minor>.<patch>
    Linux:- node-v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-linux-x64-tar.xz
    Windows:- node-v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-windows-x64.zip

Since, we have two types of choices from type of package or release of Node.js- 

    - Current
    - LTS

Recommended is LTS.

There are below mentioned ways to install:-
 - Binary
 - Default package manager of Operating System
 - Prebuilt Installer
 - Third party package manager (NVM etc)
 - Source code.


Linux :-

    Installing the Linux Binaries:-
        - Downloading the desired version with the help of wget
        - Unpacking it in /opt directory
            - run node from the directory
            - it doesnt have the npm
            - requires config setup for node path
    
    Installing via default Package manager:_
        1. sudo apt-get install nodejs

            Advantage is when you update the underlying system the nodejs will update automatically.
            Drawback is install from the default repository which is very less frequently update
        2. By adding another repository:-

            https://github.com/nodesource/distributions
            https://github.com/nodesource/distributions?tab=readme-ov-file#ubuntu-versions


    Node Version manager (nvm):-

        From official website(https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager):-

        #1 installs nvm (Node Version Manager)
        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash


        #2 download and install Node.js (you may need to restart the terminal)
        nvm install 22 

        #3 verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
        node -v # should print `v22.11.0`

        #4 verifies the right npm version is in the environment
        npm -v # should print `10.9.0`


    // website for official nvm
    // https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating
    // Please see the commands by scrolling or search for "nvm ls"

        Shutdown and start or Restart

        node -v
            This command should fail

        nvm ls
            shows the list of locally installed versions of Node.js

        nvm use 22
            
        node -v
