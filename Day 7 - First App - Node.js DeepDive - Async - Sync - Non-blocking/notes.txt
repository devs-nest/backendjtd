Our first node app

Node.js Vs JavaScript:
    Node.is a runtime that allows JS code to be executed outside the Browser.
    Before the creation of Node.js it was Browsers only where JavaScript could run.
    JavaScript is a Programming Language, it requires a software knows as JavaScript engine
    for compilation and runtime to run the JS code.
    Node.js is a runtime that has the capability to compile and execute JavaScript code.

Globals:

    There are some basic differences between globals or APIs offered in Browser and APIs and globals
    available in Node.js

    Browser         Node.js
    window          global
    document        process
    history         module
    location        __filename and __dirname
    navigator       require()


Node.js Composition Deep Dive:

Asynchronous Vs Synchronous code
   
    List of Goals:-
        - DSA
        - HTML/CSS
        - JavaScript
        - Node.js
        - Get hired or start working professionally


        3 + 3 + 3 + 3  = 12 months => Preparing for interview and then you will get hired.

    The above is synchronous way of dealing with goals.

    1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = get hired


Aynchronous callbacks:

Non-blocking Input & Output:
    JSON.stringify({coding: 'fun'});
    //another code

Is JavaScript asynchronous?
